# Using State Standardized Testing data to make Statistical Summaries and Inference

### Overview

Across the country, high schools are using standardized tests to predict how successful a student will be at a higher education institution. With these tests, colleges can then use the test results to determine which students to accept into their institutions from each state.


### Problem Statment
Students are usually required to take either the ACT or SAT in order to apply to and get into different universities and colleges. With most universities looking to diversify their student body, it is important for them to recruit from different states. Some states are requiring high school students to take one or the other. By requiring students to take either the SAT or the ACT, states are taking away students' ability to choose which test they would rather take.

> The new format for the SAT was released in March 2016. The new test has a score range of 400-1600, inwhich the old test was 600-2400. The old version of the SAT made scoring high grades harder, since it usually penalized wrong answers and was harder to prepare for, making the ACT more popular. The College Board who administers the SAT decided to make changes to the test, hoping to improve it's results. 

### Project Goals:
For this project, we're going to take a look at aggregate SAT and ACT scores and participation rates from each state in the United States for 2017 and 2018. We'll seek to identify trends in the data and combine our data analysis with outside research to identify likely factors influencing participation rates and scores in various states.

### Datasets

We will be looking at SAT and ACT data from 2017 and 2018. The data gives the average for SAT and ACT scores by state, as well as participation rates, for the graduating class of 2017 and 2018:

- [2017 SAT Scores(csv)](./data/sat_2017.csv)
- [2017 ACT Scores(csv)](./data/act_2017.csv)
- [2018 SAT Scores(pdf)](https://reports.collegeboard.org/sat-suite-program-results/state-results)
- [2018 ACT Scores(pdf)](http://www.act.org/content/dam/act/unsecured/documents/cccr2018/Average-Scores-by-State.pdf)
